// Promoting these into the variant payload (instead of one Action
// variant per axis) keeps the dispatcher's match arm exhaustive
// without a `_ => log::error!(...)` "fan-out missed inner-match"
// guard, and eliminates the `set_color_bg / _text / _border`-style
// listing tax across `KeybindConfig`, `is_destructive`,
// `wasm_compatibility`, and `context`.
//
// Each carries a kv-key string at the boundary so the verb-core's
// existing `apply_kvs`-style trait dispatch reaches the same code
// path the typed `bg|text|border` console kv would have hit.
