//! The desktop user-tier fallback chain, composed once.

//! Native has the same two candidate sources for every user-tier
//! config file — an explicit CLI path, then
//! `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mandala/<filename>` (with the `$HOME/.config`
//! fallback) — in that order. [`load_desktop_layered`] is that
//! composition, and it is the native peer of
//! `web_storage::load_web_layered`: both name their platform's
//! layers once and hand them to the shared
//! [`super::layered::load_layered`] driver.
//!
//! The three desktop loaders (keybinds, mutations, macros) used to
//! open-code the layer construction, so the `exists()` policy below
//! lived as a comment in two files and a third variant in the
//! macros loader. It lives here now, once.

/// Load a user-tier config on desktop: the explicit CLI path first,

/// `$HOME/.config` fallback), then nothing.
///
/// `label` names the config in log lines (`"keybinds"`,
/// `"mutations"`, `"macros"`). `explicit_path` is `None` for a config
/// that has no CLI flag — the layer is then not built at all rather
/// than built and skipped. Returns the parsed value plus the resolved
/// path of the layer that produced it, owned so the caller can log it
/// after the borrowed layer list is gone.
///
/// Never fails: every layer failure is logged by the driver and the
/// walk continues, so `None` simply means "use your defaults".
///
/// **Precedence asymmetry, deliberate and singly-owned:** only the
/// XDG layer is filtered on `exists()`. An absent user config is the
/// normal case and must stay silent, whereas an explicit
/// `--keybinds <path>` that does not resolve is a user error worth a
/// warning — so the explicit layer is offered to the driver
/// unfiltered and its `stat` failure surfaces. Changing that policy
/// is a change to this function, not to three call sites.
///
/// Costs: one small `Vec` of at most two layers, one `xdg_mandala_path`
/// resolution, and one `Display` render per resolved path — both are
/// rendered up front, before the walk, so the layer list can borrow
/// them (see the comment on that pair below). The `stat` and the read
/// only happen for layers the driver actually reaches.
