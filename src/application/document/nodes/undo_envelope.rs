//! The one snapshot → mutate → verdict → undo-push → auto-fit
//! envelope every node-scoped document setter runs inside.
//!
//! Three undo variants describe a per-node edit —
//! [`UndoAction::EditNodeStyle`], [`UndoAction::EditNodeText`],
//! and [`UndoAction::EditNodeAabb`] — and each one used to be
//! open-coded at a dozen call sites, together with the
//! `canvas_default` clone + `grow_one_node_to_fit_text` +
//! `grow_one_node_to_fit_border` tail. That fan-out shipped real
//! bugs twice (see the "Pre-fix" narrations on
//! [`UndoAction::EditNodeStyle`] and
//! [`MindMapDocument::set_node_size`]): a copy got fixed, its
//! siblings did not.
//!
//! Everything here exists so that a change to the envelope is a
//! one-site change. The pieces:
//!
//! - [`NodeEditTail`] — the post-commit passes a setter opts into.
//!   Auto-fit is a *policy* of the edit, not of the envelope: a
//!   color-only setter must not pay for a text re-measure, and a
//!   structural setter must additionally repair selection state.
//! - [`MindMapDocument::mutate_node_with_style_undo`] /
//!   [`MindMapDocument::mutate_node_with_text_undo`] — the two
//!   closure-verdict envelopes. The closure returns `Some(value)`
//!   to commit and `None` to declare a no-op.
//! - [`MindMapDocument::mutate_node_with_aabb_undo`] — the
//!   self-verdict envelope. `EditNodeAabb` carries exactly
//!   `(position, size)`, so the envelope compares those itself
//!   *after* the auto-fit tail; a framed node whose border-grow
//!   inflates past the requested size still no-ops on the second
//!   identical call.
//! - The two section-scoped wrappers, which narrow the closure to
//!   one [`MindSection`] and fold the index lookup in.
//!
//! **No-op semantics.** A `None` verdict restores `style`,
//! `sections`, `position` and `size` from the snapshot already
//! taken for the undo entry, pushes nothing, and leaves `dirty`
//! alone. That is the whole point of the closure-verdict shape: a
//! caller can mutate first and decide afterwards without reaching
//! for the `undo_stack.pop()` anti-pattern (which cannot restore
//! `dirty` and breaks the undo-LIFO invariant if any other entry
//! slips in between the push and the pop).
//!
//! **The restore set is the contract, and it is not the whole
//! node.** Those four fields are exactly what
//! [`UndoAction::EditNodeStyle`] reverses, and a superset of what
//! [`UndoAction::EditNodeText`] reverses (which carries no
//! `before_style`). A closure passed to any envelope here must
//! therefore confine itself to `style`, `sections`, `position` and
//! `size`. Everything else on [`MindNode`] is **out of bounds**:
//! `notes`, `folded`, `color_schema`, `channel`,
//! `trigger_bindings`, `inline_mutations`, `inline_macros`,
//! `min_zoom_to_render`, `max_zoom_to_render`, `parent_id`, `id`,
//! `layout`. A closure that writes one of those persists it on a
//! no-op verdict *and* leaves it un-undoable on a commit — the
//! `EditNodeStyle` / `EditNodeText` arms of `undo()` will not put
//! it back. No caller does this today; a mutation that needs one
//! of those fields wants `UndoAction::CustomMutation` (which
//! snapshots a whole `target_scope` window) or a new variant, not
//! this envelope.
//!
//! **Missing node.** Every envelope resolves the id first and
//! yields the no-op result when it does not exist, so callers
//! never index a stale id — `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md` §9.
