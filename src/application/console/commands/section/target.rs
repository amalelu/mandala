//! Section-target resolution — the single cascade that turns a

//! index a per-section operation writes to.
//!
//! Three call sites need this answer and each used to carry its
//! own copy of the rule table: the `section …` verb family
//! (`super::execute_section`), the `section frame …` sibling
//! (`super::frame`), and the keybind / macro `Action` arms in
//! `crate::application::app::dispatch::cross_dispatch::style`.
//! The copies drifted at least once (review-fix CRIT-2: the

//! cascade now lives here once and the three legitimate
