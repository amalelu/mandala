//! Canvas hit-test resolution over the portal and connection-label
//! trees (§T1 — hit-test math is a fundamental).
//!
//! Two things are pinned here.
//!
//! **Overlap resolution is decided by geometry.** Portal icons can
//! overlap (two portal edges leaving the same node border point at
//! different marker sizes) and edge labels can overlap (crossing
//! edges). The winner is the smallest-area element — the topmost
//! one visually — and it must not move when the *names* of the
//! nodes involved change, nor between one run of the app and the
//! next.
//!
//! The predecessor resolved overlaps by `FxHashMap` iteration order
//! over `(EdgeKey, endpoint)` keys, so the winner was a function of
//! key hashes rather than of geometry. Over the 400-fixture sweep in
//! [`test_portal_overlap_always_resolves_to_the_smaller_icon`] it
//! picked the larger, occluded icon in roughly 220–250 of the 400 —
//! the exact count differs every run, because the renderer's setters
//! took a `std::collections::HashMap` and re-collected it into the
//! `FxHashMap`, so hashbrown's insertion order (and with it the
//! resolution of group collisions) rode on `std`'s per-process
//! `RandomState` seed. Five separate processes measured 231, 224,
//! 229, 218 and 229.
//!
//! **Migrating routing onto the tree changed no answers.** The
//! differential harness sweeps thousands of synthetic click points
//! across a whole map — a coarse lattice over the canvas plus a
//! fine lattice around each element plus every element's exact
//! corners — and compares the tree/BVH answer against an
//! independent oracle: a linear scan over the same rectangles the
//! deleted flat maps were built from. Every point covered by
//! exactly one rectangle must agree exactly; points covered by
//! several are where the old path was arbitrary, and the harness
//! asserts the new path picks the smallest-area candidate there.
//! Each sweep asserts its own coverage so it cannot silently
//! degenerate into probing empty canvas.
//!
//! The sweep found a real defect on the way in: the BVH's
//! shape-refinement step re-derived an area's local frame from
//! `position` and `render_bounds` instead of from the `min` / `max`
//! its own AABB test had just used, and f32's non-associative
//! addition made the two disagree on the far edge. See
//! `gfx_structs::tests::bvh_descent_tests::test_bvh_far_edge_hit_survives_float_rounding`.
